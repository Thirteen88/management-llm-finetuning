Over the past two quarters, our delivered story points have dropped 15%. There are three primary causes: first, we've inherited technical debt from the acquisition integration; second, our team size grew 40% and onboarding has impacted productivity; third, we've prioritized quality and testing, which slows initial delivery but reduces rework."

More importantly, our quality metrics are improving - bug reports are down 35% and customer satisfaction with feature stability is up. The short-term velocity hit is investing in long-term predictability."

The returns will come, but not immediately."
