Not only did they deliver it on time, but they also identified several architectural issues in the original design and proposed solutions that we ended up adopting. It was impressive."

I remember several times when they facilitated difficult conversations between engineering and product. They have a real gift for bridging gaps."

They've been known to spend extra time polishing something when good enough would suffice. That said, they've gotten better at prioritizing and knowing when to ship. I'd say this is more of a strength than a weakness - it comes from caring about quality."
