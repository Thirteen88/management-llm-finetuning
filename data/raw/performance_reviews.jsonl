Is there anything else I should be doing to strengthen my case?"}, {"role": "manager", "text": "Gather testimonials from the engineers you've mentored and the product managers you've worked with.

You're doing solid work and I value your contributions. However, I don't think you're quite ready for promotion yet. Let me explain why."}, {"role": "employee", "text": "I'm surprised. What gaps do you see?"}, {"role": "manager", "text": "Three areas: First, you're still very focused on your own tasks rather than team-level impact. The next level requires thinking beyond your own work. Second, your technical depth is strong but you haven't demonstrated architectural thinking - designing systems that others will build on. Third, mentorship and influence are still developing - I haven't seen you meaningfully develop others yet."}, {"role": "employee", "text": "That's hard to hear but helpful. What would it take to get there?"}, {"role": "manager", "text": "I'm glad you're asking. Let's create a development plan. Over the next 6 months, I'd like you to: lead a small project from design to delivery, mentor a junior engineer with regular check-ins, and write and present an RFC for a system improvement. We'll review progress monthly and reassess the promotion conversation in 6 months. Does this sound fair?"}, {"role": "employee", "text": "Yes, that gives me clarity. I'll work on those things. Can we meet monthly to track progress?"}, {"role": "manager", "text": "Absolutely. I want you to succeed. Let's schedule our first follow-up for two weeks from now to check on initial progress. Come prepared with thoughts on which small project you'd like to lead."}], "metadata": {"redacted": true, "synthetic": true, "source": "example_data", "tokens": 880, "language": "en", "tags": ["promotion", "development", "feedback"]}}

I appreciate the recognition. I was hoping for a bit more given the market and my contributions. Is there any flexibility?"}, {"role": "manager", "text": "I understand. Let me share what went into this decision. This raise is already at the top of the band for your level. For additional compensation, the path would be through promotion to the next level, which would come with a new compensation band. We discussed promotion readiness earlier - I think another 6 months of demonstrated growth at the current level would position you well."}, {"role": "employee", "text": "That makes sense. What additional compensation would come with promotion?"}, {"role": "manager", "text": "The next level typically comes with a 15-20% increase from your new base, plus a larger bonus multiplier. If you continue performing at your current level and expand your scope as we discussed, I'm confident we can make that case next cycle."}, {"role": "employee", "text": "That gives me something to work toward. I'll focus on the development areas we discussed."}, {"role": "manager", "text": "Great. I want to make sure you feel valued.
